                <br>
                <p class="info-text">I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="info-text">While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="info-subtitle">How I got started</h3>
                <br>
                <p class="info-text">I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="info-text">That helped me grow what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
